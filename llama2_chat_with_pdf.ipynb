Everything presented  \\non a role-based dashboard.\\nGETINGE ONLINE ACUTE CARE PRODUCTS3\\nStay one step ahead and maximize uptime\\nGetinge Online offers instant access to device data, \\nwhich makes it faster and easier for service teams to \\ntroubleshoot issues and work out a solution. It includes \\nindividualized perspectives on service needs and  \\nremote support from experts, all over the world.  \\nThe service improves asset management by providing an \\neasy overview of installed base status and service history. \\nIt also gives an indication when preventive maintenance \\nis due. Information that will ease the life for a biomed  \\nand ensure equipment uptime.\\nFrom better insight comes improved efficiency\\nOur online service is a great example of the benefits that \\nconnectivity brings to healthcare. By transforming small \\ninformation to big data, Getinge Online makes it easier \\nfor clinicians and their team to adhere to protocol and be \\nmore efficient and proactive. For example by viewing and \\nanalyzing data like fresh gas flow and ventilation modes. \\nAll in the interests of a hospital. \\nIt gives the clinician the opportunity to define best \\npractice and use data as a training tool, for instance;  \\nyou can view a longer timeline to identify trends, compare \\nyear-to-year data and much more. Anytime. Anywhere.»Getinge Online is rooted in the \\ninsight that connectivity will make a \\ndifference in health care. The idea is \\nto analyze all available data and gain \\ninsights that will make life easier for \\nour customers.
